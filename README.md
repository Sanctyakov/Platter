# Platter

A simple game made with Unity 3D's basic forms and C# scripting. Hold a platter in your hand and move it around so that the ball can collect all the shinies, but be careful for it not to fall over!

Use WASD or arrow keys to rotate the platter and make the ball fall in the desired direction. It's harder than it looks!
